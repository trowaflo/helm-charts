# -- Certificate resources to manage TLS certificates via cert-manager.
# Define multiple certificates using map keys (e.g., wildcard-tls, api-tls).
# Each certificate requires:
# - enabled: bool - whether to create the certificate
# - secretName: string (REQUIRED) - name of the secret that will store the certificate
# - issuerRef: object (REQUIRED) - reference to the cert-manager Issuer or ClusterIssuer
# - dnsNames: list of strings - DNS names for the certificate
# - commonName: string (optional) - common name for the certificate
# - duration: string (optional) - certificate lifetime (e.g., "2160h" for 90 days)
# - renewBefore: string (optional) - when to renew before expiry (e.g., "360h" for 15 days)
#
# ℹ️ NOTE: For Let's Encrypt certificates, cert-manager automatically detects the certificate
# expiry from the issued certificate and handles renewal. The duration/renewBefore fields are
# OPTIONAL - if not specified, cert-manager uses sensible defaults (90 days duration, renew
# 30 days before expiry for Let's Encrypt). Only set these if you need custom values.
#
# Example:
#   certificates:
#     wildcard-tls:
#       enabled: true
#       secretName: wildcard-tls
#       issuerRef:
#         name: letsencrypt-prod
#         kind: ClusterIssuer
#       dnsNames:
#         - "*.example.com"
#         - "example.com"
#       commonName: "*.example.com"
#       # duration and renewBefore are optional - cert-manager auto-detects from Let's Encrypt
#
# @default -- {} (empty, no certificates managed by default)
certificates: {}

# -- ReferenceGrants allow Gateway API resources in other namespaces to reference
# secrets in the cert-manager-platform namespace (where certificates are stored).
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: ReferenceGrants are Gateway API resources (gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1)
# that require Gateway API CRDs to be installed cluster-wide. Enabling ReferenceGrants
# without Gateway API CRDs installed will cause deployment failures.
#
# Only configure this section when using Gateway API (e.g., with kgateway-platform chart).
# Define multiple grants using map keys (e.g., allow-kgateway-platform, allow-dmz-gateway).
# Each grant must have 'enabled: true' and 'from'/'to' configuration.
#
# Example:
#   referenceGrants:
#     allow-kgateway-platform:
#       enabled: true
#       from:
#         - kind: Gateway
#           namespace: kgateway-platform
#       to:
#         - kind: Secret
#
# @default -- {} (empty, configure only when using Gateway API)
