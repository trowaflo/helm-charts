{{/*
Deprecated template: gateway.yaml

This file previously rendered Gateway, GatewayParameters, and HTTPListenerPolicy
resources inline. That logic has been migrated to the modular templates:
  - gateways.yaml
  - gatewayparameters.yaml
  - http-listener-policy.yaml
which use the shared helpers in _helpers-gateways.tpl.

This template is intentionally left empty to avoid duplicate resource definitions
and potential inconsistencies. It is kept only to preserve the original file
name/path in the chart structure.
