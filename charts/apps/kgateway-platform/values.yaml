# -- Override the base name used in resource naming.
# This chart uses a simplified naming convention where resources are named "<base-name>-<key>".
# By default, the base name comes from the chart/release name (for example, "kgateway": kgateway-public, kgateway-private, etc.).
#
# nameOverride is only respected by the kgateway-platform.name helper and can change this base name where that helper is used.
# It does not affect the kgateway-platform.fullname helper, which currently always derives its value from .Release.Name.
#
# @default -- "" (uses the chart/release name via the name helper)
nameOverride: ""

# -- Override the full name used in resource naming (reserved for helpers that support it).
# In this chart, the simplified kgateway-platform.fullname helper currently ignores fullnameOverride and always uses .Release.Name.
# This value is kept for compatibility/future use; setting it has no effect unless templates/helpers explicitly reference it.
#
# @default -- "" (unused by the current fullname helper)
fullnameOverride: ""

# -- Gateway configuration. Define multiple gateways by adding entries with any key name.
# Each gateway requires:
# - enabled: bool
# - address: string (REQUIRED) - IP address for the gateway
# - name: string (optional) - defaults to "<release-name>-<key>"
# - ipSlot: string (optional) - defaults to key name, used for Cilium LoadBalancerIPPool selector
#
# Example:
#   gateways:
#     public:
#       enabled: true
#       address: "192.168.1.1"
#       ipSlot: public
#     private:
#       enabled: true
#       address: "192.168.1.2"
#       ipSlot: private
#
# @default -- {} (empty, user must configure gateways)
gateways: {}

# -- TLS secret configuration for gateway HTTPS listeners.
# Specify the secret name and optional namespace.
#
# Example:
#   tlsSecret:
#     name: "wildcard-tls"
#     namespace: "cert-manager"
#
# Note: Cross-namespace secret references require a ReferenceGrant in the secret's
# namespace (managed by cert-manager-platform chart, not this chart).
#
# @default -- {} (empty map, user must configure)
tlsSecret: {}

# -- HTTP listener policies for WebSocket upgrade support.
# Map structure where keys reference gateway keys from the gateways map.
# Each policy requires:
# - enabled: bool
# - targetGateway: string (REQUIRED) - must match a gateway key
# - name: string (optional) - defaults to policy key
# - enabledUpgrades: list of strings (optional) - defaults to ["websocket"]
#
# Example:
#   httpListenerPolicies:
#     public-ws:
#       enabled: true
#       targetGateway: "public"
#       enabledUpgrades: ["websocket"]
#     private-ws:
#       enabled: true
#       targetGateway: "private"
#       enabledUpgrades: ["websocket"]
#
# @default -- {} (empty, user must configure policies)
httpListenerPolicies: {}

# kgateway-crds subchart configuration
kgateway-crds:
  # -- Enable installation of kgateway CRDs (required for Gateway API resources)
  enabled: true

# kgateway subchart configuration
kgateway:
  # -- Enable installation of kgateway controller (required for Gateway functionality)
  enabled: true
